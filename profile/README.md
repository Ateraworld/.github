# Contributing

We allow people who love the project and the idea to contribute in creating the **activities reports and relations**.

To begin a collaboration, send an email to <span>atera.world@gmail.com</span> and we will contact you back as soon as possible üòÅ.

## Environment

To start contributing, we will provide you the following tools:

- `atera CLI`: a command line tool to facilitate some tasks such as reports validation and creation, asset compression and more.
- `atera_vscode`: an extension for [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), that perfectly integrates **Atera** with the development environment. It enables to dinamically reference activities, photos and points of interests inside your reports.

To propose changes, we will allow you to create a pull request in the [atera_data](https://github.com/Ateraworld/atera_data) repository.

The changes will be **carefully analyzed** to mantain the coherence of the reports and deployed on our backend after all checks have passed.
